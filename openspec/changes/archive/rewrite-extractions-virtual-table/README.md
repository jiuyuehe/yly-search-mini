# Archived Change: rewrite-extractions-virtual-table

This change has been archived manually (openspec CLI not available). It replaced the Handsontable-based extraction form detail view with an Element Plus virtual table implementation featuring grouped headers, inline editing, sorting, filtering, and batch save.

Key artifacts retained:
- proposal.md
- design.md
- tasks.md
- specs/* (grouped headers, inline editing, navigation link, sorting/filtering, virtual table core)

Reason for archive: Implementation complete; table migrated; HOT code removed.

If reactivation is needed, move this directory back to `openspec/changes/` and increment a new change ID.
