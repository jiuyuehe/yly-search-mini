# Capability: Grouped Headers (Archived)

## ADDED Requirements
- Requirement: Second header row groups contiguous child columns of object / array-of-object fields.
  - Scenario: Object field with 3 subfields renders a single group cell spanning width of those 3 columns.
- Requirement: Non-grouped columns render normal header cells in both rows.
  - Scenario: Simple field appears as individual header cells without grouping side effects.
